Frosttrace is a GPGPU-accelerated raytracer for landscapes.

Currently it only runs on Windows Vista or later, and requires a DirectX 11 GPU.

Binaries for Win32 are released occasionally - see downloads for those.
Command line options are available to change the window settings and such.
(Note: on first run it might take a while to compile the shaders)

Controls:
	WASD + Mouse = Camera movement
	F1 = Toggle fly-by mode
	F2 = Toggle recording mode

How to compile:
	- Have VS10 or VS11 installed, together with the latest DX SDK (comes with VS11)
	- Use CMake to configure the project
	- Open the solution and compile
To run the project from within VS make sure the debug directory is set to the correct path ($(ProjectDir)/../.. should do)
